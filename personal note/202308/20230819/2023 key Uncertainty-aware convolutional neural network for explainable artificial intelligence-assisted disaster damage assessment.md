Accurate damage assessment is a critical step in post-disaster risk assessment, mitigation, and recovery. Current practices performed by experts and reconnaissance teams in the form of field evaluation require considerable time and resources. Recent advances in remote sensing imagery, artificial intelligence (AI), and computer vision have enhanced automated and rapid disaster damage assessment. Recent literature has shown promising progress in AI-assisted aerial damage assessment. However, accounting for the uncertainty in the outcome for improved quantification of confidence and enhanced model explainability for human decision-makers remains one of the key challenges.

Overlooking uncertainty can lead to erroneous decisions, especially in highlyconsequential tasks such as damage assessment. The aim of this study is to develop uncertainty-aware deep learning models for the assessment of postdisaster damage using aerial imaging. Within the framework of variational Bayesian inference, Monte Carlo dropout sampling technique is used to propagate epistemic uncertainty in model predictions. With this stochastic setting, the model produces damage prediction labels with softmax as random variables, which helps quantify confidence in the model outcome using appropriate measures of uncertainty. Two networks are implemented and trained separately on two different disaster damage datasets consisting of unmanned aerial vehicle building footage as well as satellite-captured post-disaster imagery. The first network attains 59.4% accuracy in building classification, and the second network gives an accuracy of 55.1%. Results from uncertainty analysis, model confidence quantification, and analyzing model attention zone can lead to more explainable and risk-informed automated damage assessment outcomes using AI technology

准确的损失评估是灾后风险评估、缓解和恢复的关键步骤。当前由专家和侦察小组以现场评估形式进行的实践需要大量时间和资源。遥感图像、人工智能 (AI) 和计算机视觉的最新进展增强了灾害损失评估的自动化和快速性。最近的文献显示人工智能辅助空中损害评估方面取得了可喜的进展。然而，考虑结果的不确定性以提高人类决策者的信心量化和增强模型可解释性仍然是关键挑战之一。

忽视不确定性可能会导致错误的决策，尤其是在损失评估等重大任务中。本研究的目的是开发不确定性感知深度学习模型，用于使用航空成像评估灾后损失。在变分贝叶斯推理的框架内，蒙特卡洛丢失采样技术用于传播模型预测中的认知不确定性。通过这种随机设置，模型会生成以 softmax 作为随机变量的损伤预测标签，这有助于使用适当的不确定性度量来量化模型结果的置信度。两个网络分别在两个不同的灾害损失数据集上实施和训练，这些数据集包括无人机建筑镜头以及卫星捕获的灾后图像。第一个网络的建筑物分类准确率达到 59.4%，第二个网络的准确率达到 55.1%。不确定性分析、模型置信度量化和分析模型注意力区域的结果可以使用人工智能技术产生更具可解释性和风险信息的自动损害评估结果
