The increasing frequency and severity of water-related disasters such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, and tsunamis in low- and middle-income countries exemplify the uneven effects of global climate change. The vulnerability of high-risk societies to natural disasters has continued to increase. To develop an effective and efficient adaptation strategy, local damage assessments must be timely, exhaustive, and accurate. We propose a novel deep-learning-based solution that uses pairs of pre- and post-disaster satellite images to identify water-related disaster-affected regions. The model extracts features of preand post-disaster images and uses the feature difference with them to predict damage in the pair. We demonstrate that the model can successfully identify local destruction using less granular and less complex ground-truth data than those used by previous segmentation models. When tested with various waterrelated disasters, our detection model reported an accuracy of 85.9% in spotting areas with damaged buildings. It also achieved a reliable performance of 80.3% in out-of-domain settings. Our deep learning-based damage assessment model can help direct resources to areas most vulnerable to climate disasters, reducing their impacts while promoting adaptive capacities for climate-resilient development in the most vulnerable regions.

低收入和中等收入国家洪水、龙卷风、飓风和海啸等与水有关的灾害的频率和严重程度日益增加，说明了全球气候变化影响的不平衡。高风险社会对自然灾害的脆弱性持续增加。为了制定有效且高效的适应策略，当地损害评估必须及时、详尽且准确。我们提出了一种基于深度学习的新型解决方案，该解决方案使用成对的灾前和灾后卫星图像来识别与水相关的受灾地区。该模型提取灾前和灾后图像的特征，并利用它们的特征差异来预测对中的损坏情况。我们证明，与以前的分割模型相比，该模型可以使用更细粒度和更简单的地面实况数据来成功识别局部破坏。在对各种与水有关的灾害进行测试时，我们的检测模型报告发现建筑物受损区域的准确率为 85.9%。它还在域外设置中实现了 80.3% 的可靠性能。我们基于深度学习的损害评估模型可以帮助将资源引导到最容易遭受气候灾害的地区，减少其影响，同时提高最脆弱地区的气候适应能力发展的适应能力。
