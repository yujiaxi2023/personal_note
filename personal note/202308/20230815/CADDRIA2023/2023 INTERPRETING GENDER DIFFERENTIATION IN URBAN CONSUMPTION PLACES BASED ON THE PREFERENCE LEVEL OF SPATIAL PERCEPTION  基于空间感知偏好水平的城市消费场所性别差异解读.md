Taking Street view map and Random forest model as the applications and four consumption places in Beijing as case studies, this study proposes a method that maps spatial perception preferences at the local scale to the global scale by following steps: Firstly, download street view images of consumption places from BaiduMap API, then combined the preference of the local street view images scores by the volunteers of both genders and the proportion of visual elements in the images, predicted the preference level of case areas at the global scale by the Random forest model, and finally, through FCN model and sDNA model, fully revealed the gender differentiation phenomenon of consumption places at the image, function and location contents. The results indicate that both genders have a preference for places of Catering function. Besides, females generally prefer consumption places with more conspicuous signboards, greening and better spatial design quality, and have clear pre-determined consumption targets; males generally prefer consumption places with more conspicuous columns, smaller signboards, and have less demand for the spatial design quality of consumption places.

以街景地图和随机森林模型为应用，以北京的四个消费场所为案例，提出了一种将局部尺度的空间感知偏好映射到全球尺度的方法，步骤如下：从百度地图API获取消费地点，然后结合不同性别志愿者对当地街景图像评分的偏好以及图像中视觉元素的比例，通过随机森林模型预测全球范围内案例区域的偏好水平，最后，通过FCN模型和sDNA模型，充分揭示了消费场所在形象、功能和区位内容上的性别差异现象。结果表明，男女都对餐饮功能场所存在偏好。此外，女性普遍偏好招牌较为醒目、绿化程度较高、空间设计质量较好的消费场所，且有明确的消费目标；男性普遍偏好立柱较为显眼、招牌较小的消费场所，对消费场所的空间设计品质要求较低。
