PM2.5 has become a significant factor contributing to the haze outbreak in mainland China, which has negative impacts for public health. The current agility of CFD-based modelling to reveal in real-time the changes in PM2.5 concentrations in response to (proposed) changes in urban form limits its practical applications in the design processes. To support urban design for better air quality (AQ), this study presents a machine learning approach to test: (1) that the spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentrations measured in an urban area reflects the area’s capacity to disperse particle air pollution; (2) that the PM2.5 concentration measurements can be linked to certain urban form attributes of that area. A Convolutional Neural Network algorithm called Residual Neural Network (ResNet) was trained and tested using the ChinaHighPM2.5 and urban form datasets. The result is a ResNet-AQ predictor for the city centre area in Beijing which had one of the highest air pollution levels within the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The urban area covered by the ResNet-AQ predictor contains 4,000 grid cells (approx. 25.3 km x 25.3 km), of which 1,200 (30%) cells were selected randomly for testing. The ResNet-AQ prediction accuracy achieved 87.3% after 100 iterations. An end-use scenario is presented to show how a social housing project can be supported by the AQ predictor to achieve better urban air quality performance.

PM2.5已成为导致中国大陆雾霾爆发的重要因素，给公众健康带来负面影响。目前基于 CFD 的建模能够灵活地实时揭示 PM2.5 浓度的变化，以响应（拟议的）城市形态变化，但限制了其在设计过程中的实际应用。为了支持改善空气质量 (AQ) 的城市设计，本研究提出了一种机器学习方法来测试：(1) 城市地区测量的 PM2.5 浓度的空间分布反映了该地区分散颗粒空气污染的能力； (2) PM2.5 浓度测量值可以与该地区的某些城市形态属性相关联。使用 ChinaHighPM2.5 和城市形态数据集训练和测试称为残差神经网络 (ResNet) 的卷积神经网络算法。结果是北京市中心地区的 ResNet-AQ 预测器，该地区是京津冀地区空气污染水平最高的地区之一。 ResNet-AQ预测器覆盖的城市区域包含4,000个网格单元（约25.3 km x 25.3 km），其中随机选择1,200个（30%）单元进行测试。经过 100 次迭代后，ResNet-AQ 预测精度达到 87.3%。提出了一个最终使用场景，以展示空气质量预测器如何支持社会住房项目，以实现更好的城市空气质量表现。
