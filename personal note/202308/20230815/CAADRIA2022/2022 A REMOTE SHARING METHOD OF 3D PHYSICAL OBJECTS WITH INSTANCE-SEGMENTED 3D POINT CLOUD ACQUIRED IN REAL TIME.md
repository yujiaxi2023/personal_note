In the field of architecture and urban design, physical models are used in design meetings. Furthermore, teleconferencing via the internet has begun to be widely used in society due to COVID-19 and in preparation for disasters. Although conventional web conferencing can share only 2D information through screens, it is expected that interactive screen sharing of physical objects will enable smoother remote conferencing. A system that can manipulate point clouds in clusters by dividing real-time point clouds captured from 3D real objects by distance has been reported as a way to share physical objects. However, because the point clouds are divided by distance between the two clusters when the point clouds get closer than some threshold, they become treated as a single object. In this study, we aim to develop a system that uses instance segmentation to divide point clouds by region rather than by distance between objects. This system is expected to contribute to the realisation of better architectural and urban design processes without any misunderstandings among the parties involved and to the reduction of unnecessary energy consumption due to travel for face-to-face meetings.

在建筑和城市设计领域，物理模型用于设计会议。此外，由于 COVID-19 和灾难准备，通过互联网进行的电话会议已开始在社会中广泛使用。尽管传统的网络会议只能通过屏幕共享2D信息，但物理对象的交互式屏幕共享有望使远程会议更加顺畅。据报道，一种可以通过将从 3D 真实对象捕获的实时点云除以距离来操纵集群中的点云的系统，作为共享物理对象的一种方式。然而，由于当点云接近某个阈值时，点云会被两个簇之间的距离分开，因此它们会被视为单个对象。在本研究中，我们的目标是开发一个系统，该系统使用实例分割按区域而不是按对象之间的距离来划分点云。该系统预计将有助于实现更好的建筑和城市设计流程，避免相关各方之间产生任何误解，并减少因参加面对面会议而导致的不必要的能源消耗。
